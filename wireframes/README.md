This folder is intended to be used to circulate draft wireframes. 

.PNG files are images viewable by everyone, and are referenced by some of the .md files in docs/discussion 

.bmml files are Balsamiq files, which can be forked / edited by those with access to Balsamiq (the wireframe tool  used by some members of the BCDevExchange dev team). https://balsamiq.com/
