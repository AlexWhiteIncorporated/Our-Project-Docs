**Release 1:** A visual identifier will be used to identify the current state for all elements within and supported by the BCDevExchange. This will include Projects and Resources, as well as functionality and pages within the BCDevExchange website. Below are prototype images that may be used to identify the current state of each element, with terminology corresponding to the proposed [[Project States|project states]].

__Symbol Icons__

**Release 1:** 
These are somewhat more fun version of the Letter Icon, serving the same purpose, but may be better used later in the development of the BCDevExchange, once the concepts around Project state are better socialized.

__Small Banner__

**Release 1:** These should be sized to display at 1.5cm high x 2.94cm wide. These can be used to call out larger areas of content, pop ups, or other content or functions for which the large banner is not a good choice.
