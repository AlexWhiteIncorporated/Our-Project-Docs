##Organizations

A BCDevExchange Organization is an entity that exists parallel to profiles. Where account profiles are a representation of an individual’s interactions with BCDevExchange, an Organization is a representation of a group’s interactions with BCDevExchange.
 
**Release 1:** Organizations will not exist as distinct entities. There is a parallel / similar concept in GitHub, which may be able to be leveraged to some degree, such as being displayed on BCDevExchange as the owner of a Repo registered by one of the GitHub Organization’s owner profiles.

**Future State:** An Organization can be created by any user on BCDevExchange. Creating an Organization automatically creates a new profile associated to the account of the user who created it, giving this user the privileges to maintain a profile specific to the newly created Organization. The owner of an Organization may invite other people to join their Organization, and may maintain their privileges as they pertain to that Organization, including identifying other owners. 

An Organization has its own description and Organization specific profile, which track things like Org specific contact information, payment information, resources, projects, descriptions, and logos. Members of an Organization may perform actions on behalf of that Org (such as listing new resources), by selecting the Org profile when signing in. Members of an Org can view a feed of organization specific activity, so they can stay up to date with what their co-workers / peers have been up to. 

In addition to being invited into an Org, users can proactively request an invite to an Org, which can then be accepted by members of the Org who have appropriate privileges within that Org.

Could consider creating an Organization of BCDevExchange within the BCDevExchange site framework, allowing for different people to get involved and have input into projects belonging to the BCDevExchange (very meta).
