# Our Design Principles...
...were created as a group during Sprint 4 and have proved very useful in guiding the development team towards innovative solutions.
<ul>
<li>Rely on external data, functions and services as much as possible</li>
<li>Perfection is not the goal of the first iteration</li>
<li>Foster credibility with the community</li>
<li>Develop incrementally - don't assume end state functionality</li>
<li>Web App is platform agnostic including mobile</li>
<li>Go where the community is - don't expect them to come to us</li>
<li>Open by default, share-able, reusable and transparent</li>
<li>Be bold and take the calculated risk</li>
<li>Failing early is far better than failing late</li>
<li>Be agile: change happens, experiments die and that's good!</li>
</ul>
