# Welcome to the BCDevExchange discussion folder!

This is where we are sharing the concepts and entities that are being being considered to build the framework for BCDevExchange.org. Most of the content in here is continuing to be defined and refined, and should be considered [Research State](projectstates.md).

If creating a page, please consider adding a Research State Badge, by adding the below code (adds Research State Badge with alt text description).
