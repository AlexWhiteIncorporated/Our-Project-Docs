##State Labels

**Release 1:** A visual identifier will be used to identify the current state for all elements within and supported by the BCDevExchange. This will include Projects and Resources, as well as functionality and pages within the BCDevExchange website. Below are prototype images that may be used to identify the current state of each element, with terminology corresponding to the proposed [Project States](projectstates.md). 

##Labels for Web Pages / Content  
__Badges__

**Release 1:** BCDevExchange content located within GitHub will be labelled with a similar convention as the above Project States, but utilize the following badge system.

##Labels for Documents

__Letter Icons__

**Release 1:** These icons are intended to be used where space is a concern. They should be sized to display at 1cm x 1cm.

__Symbol Icons__

**Release 1:** 
These are somewhat more fun version of the Letter Icon, serving the same purpose, but may be better used later in the development of the BCDevExchange, once the concepts around Project state are better socialized.

__Small Banner__

**Release 1:** These should be sized to display at 1.5cm high x 2.94cm wide. These can be used to call out larger areas of content, pop ups, or other content or functions for which the large banner is not a good choice.
