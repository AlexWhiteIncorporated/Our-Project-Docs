###Project Backlogs

**Future Release:** A backlog is a list of activities, ideas, features, or enhancements being considered for a Project. Itâ€™s proposed that the GitHub Issues functionality be used to support backlogs for Projects located in GitHub. The issue list associated with a project repo would hold its backlog.

If using GitHub issues to support the display of a project backlog, it may be important to consider ways to filter or flag which issues are displayed as part of the backlog. It's suggested that issue labels (such as 'backlog-issue', 'backlog-feature' or 'backlog-opportunity',  be used to indicate which issues should be visible as part of a public / BCDevExchange facing project backlog. Issues that are not labelled using this convention would not display as part of the public / BCDevExchange project backlog, and could be used to track internal issues, discussions, questions or other issues relevant to the repo in question.
