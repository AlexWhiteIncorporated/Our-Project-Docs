##Interests 

**Future State:** For each [profile](profiles.md), the user can define what the profile is interested in. This involved identifying one or more combinations of tags (using the same pool of Resource and Project tags) to create interests. For example, a user could identify two different interests for their Individual profile of [datasets, environment, forestry, animals, bears] and [APIs, transactional, environment], and other types of interests defined for their other profiles. These defined interests can be used as automatic filter / search criteria when searching for Resources, or drive optional notification emails alerting the user to new Resources similar to their interests. When aggregated across accounts / profiles, these could be used to identify what sorts of things the BCDevExchange community as a whole is interested in obtaining, and help inform Resource providers of what sort of stuff is wanted / needed.
